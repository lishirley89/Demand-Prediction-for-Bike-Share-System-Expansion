# Demand Prediction for Bike Share System Expansion

This project aims to predict the trip demand at new stations when bike share systems consider expanding. To plan successful bike share systems , many cities start from a small-scale pilot and gradually expand the system to cover more areas. Planning new stations based on existing ones over time requires prediction of the number of trips generated by these new stations across the whole system. This project will leverage historical trip data from existing stations and predict ridership at candidate sites.


### Divvy system has been expanding over the past few years

## Project Overview

This project develops predictive models for bike share station demand by integrating multiple data sources including:
- **Divvy bike share trip data** (2021-2025)
- **Census demographic data** (Cook County)
- **Points of Interest (POI) data** from OpenStreetMap
- **Transportation infrastructure** (CTA stations, bus stops, bike routes)
- **Spatial proximity metrics** (station density at various distances)

The models predict four key metrics:
- `cbike_start`: Average daily classic bike trip starts by month
- `cbike_end`: Average daily classic bike trip ends by month  
- `ebike_start`: Average daily electric bike trip starts by month
- `ebike_end`: Average daily electric bike trip ends per month

## Key Results

### Model Performance Summary

| Model Type | Target Variable | Test R² | Test RMSE | Test MAE |
|------------|----------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **XGBoost** | cbike_start | **0.796** | 4.93 | 2.25 |
| **XGBoost** | cbike_end | **0.795** | 4.95 | 2.27 |
| **XGBoost** | ebike_start | **0.897** | 2.87 | 1.36 |
| **XGBoost** | ebike_end | **0.892** | 2.92 | 1.36 |
| Linear Regression | cbike_start | 0.364 | 8.72 | 5.89 |
| Linear Regression | cbike_end | 0.353 | 8.78 | 5.90 |
| Linear Regression | ebike_start | 0.552 | 5.99 | 3.54 |
| Linear Regression | ebike_end | 0.544 | 6.01 | 3.52 |

### Key Findings

1. **XGBoost significantly outperforms Linear Regression** across all target variables
2. **Electric bike demand is more predictable** than classic bike demand (R² > 0.89 vs ~0.80)
3. **Seasonal patterns are critical** - month features rank among top predictors
4. **Socioeconomic factors matter** - per capita income and demographic composition are highly influential
5. **Infrastructure proximity** - nearby stations and transportation access significantly impact demand
